# SITFO
SITFO is a high-dimensional expensive optimization algorithm, which uses a surrogate information transfer from RBF model to Kriging model and a surrogate information fusion for RBF and Kriging model. The algorithm is coded using Matlab toolbox PlatEMO 4.0: Tian, Ye, et al. "PlatEMO: A MATLAB platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization [educational forum]." IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine 12.4 (2017): 73-87.
More details for NSGAIII-EHVI are shown in the paper "Pang, Yong, et al. "Surrogate information transfer and fusion in high-dimensional expensive optimization problems." Swarm and Evolutionary Computation 88 (2024): 101586."
